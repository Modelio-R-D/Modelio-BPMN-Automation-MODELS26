# Modelio BPMN Generator with Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini AI or Local LLM

Generate BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) diagrams in [Modelio](https://www.modelio.org/) using AI. Describe your business process in plain language and get a complete, runnable Modelio macro.

![BPMN Example](docs/images/expense-approval-example.png)

## Overview

This project enables you to:

- **Describe a business process in plain language** and have Claude, ChatGPT, or Gemini generate the Modelio macro
- **Automatically create BPMN diagrams** with lanes, tasks, gateways, data objects, and flows
- **Customize layout** with configurable spacing, task dimensions, and positioning

## Features

- ✅ Support for all common BPMN elements (Start/End Events, User/Service/Manual Tasks, Gateways)
- ✅ **Data Objects** with input/output associations to tasks
- ✅ Automatic swim lane creation and element positioning
- ✅ Sequence flows with labels for gateway decisions
- ✅ Configurable task dimensions and spacing
- ✅ Robust element unmasking with fallback mechanisms
- ✅ Two-file architecture for faster, more reliable AI generation
- ✅ **NEW: Export/Import** - Clone or migrate existing diagrams between projects
- ✅ **NEW: Extended element types** - Script, Business Rule, Send/Receive tasks, additional gateways and events

## Requirements

- [Modelio](https://www.modelio.org/) 5.0 or later
- Access to [Claude](https://claude.ai/), [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) with GPT-4o, or [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/)
- Also works with Qwen via LM Studio—see the guide [here](lm_studio/LMStudio_Qwen_Guide_v5_Final.md)

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Install the Helper Library (One Time)

Copy [`BPMN_Helpers.py`](BPMN_Helpers.py) to your Modelio macros folder:

| OS | Path |
|----|------|
| Windows (workaround) | `C:\<your Modelio installation folder>\.modelio\5.4\macros\BPMN_Helpers.py` |
| Linux | `~/.modelio/5.4/macros/BPMN_Helpers.py` |

> Replace `5.4` with your Modelio version. Create the `macros` folder if it doesn't exist.

### 2. Set Up Your AI Assistant

Copy the contents of [`CLAUDE_INSTRUCTIONS.md`](CLAUDE_INSTRUCTIONS.md) into:

| AI | How to Set Up |
|----|---------------|
| **Claude** | Create a Project → Add as custom instructions |
| **ChatGPT** | Add to Custom Instructions or first system message |
| **Gemini** | Add as system/developer message |
| **LM Studio + Qwen** | See [`lm_studio/LMStudio_Qwen_with_helpers.md`](lm_studio/LMStudio_Qwen_with_helpers.md) |

**Tip for ChatGPT/Gemini:** Start with: *"You are generating Modelio Jython BPMN macros. Follow these instructions exactly."*

### 3. Describe Your Process

Tell the AI what you need:

```
Create a BPMN diagram for an expense approval process with 3 lanes: 
Employee, Manager, and Finance. 

The employee submits an expense report, the manager reviews and 
approves or rejects it, and finance processes the payment.
```

### 4. Run in Modelio

1. Copy the generated Python script
2. Open Modelio and select a **Package** in the model explorer
3. Go to **Views → Script**
4. Paste the script and click **Run**

Your BPMN diagram will appear automatically!

## How It Works

### Two-File Architecture

```
┌────────────────────────────────┐
│  BPMN_Helpers.py               │  ← Install once in Modelio
│  (500+ lines of tested code)   │
└────────────────────────────────┘
              ▲
              │ execfile()
              │
┌────────────────────────────────┐
│  YourProcess.py                │  ← AI generates this (~100 lines)
│  (Pure configuration)          │
└────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Benefits:**
- ⚡ **Fast generation** - AI only generates configuration, not 500+ lines of helpers
- ✅ **Reliable** - Helper code is tested; only config varies
- 🔧 **Maintainable** - Fix bugs once in helper library
- 📖 **Readable** - Process structure is clear and declarative

### Generated Configuration Format

```python
CONFIG = {
    "name": "ExpenseApproval",
    "lanes": ["Employee", "Manager", "Finance"],
    "elements": [
        ("Submit Expense", START, "Employee"),
        ("Review", USER_TASK, "Manager"),
        ("Approved?", EXCLUSIVE_GW, "Manager"),
        ("Process Payment", SERVICE_TASK, "Finance"),
        # ...
    ],
    "flows": [
        ("Submit Expense", "Review", ""),
        ("Approved?", "Process Payment", "Yes"),
        ("Approved?", "Rejected", "No"),
    ],
    "layout": {
        "Submit Expense": 0,
        "Review": 1,
        "Approved?": 2,
        # ...
    },
    # Optional: Data Objects
    "data_objects": [
        ("Expense Report", "Employee", 0),
    ],
    "data_associations": [
        ("Submit Expense", "Expense Report"),
        ("Expense Report", "Review"),
    ],
}
```

### Modelio Auto-Unmask Behavior

When a BPMN diagram is created, Modelio automatically "unmasks" elements. However:

- Auto-unmask is **non-deterministic** - sometimes all elements appear, sometimes only some
- The helper library handles this with automatic fallback to manual unmasking
- Manual unmask is done at the correct Y position inside each lane

## Tips for Better AI Results

| Tip | Example |
|-----|---------|
| Name lanes clearly | "Lanes: Customer, Sales Team, Warehouse" |
| Describe decisions explicitly | "If approved, proceed; otherwise reject" |
| Mention parallel work | "HR and IT work in parallel" |
| Specify task types | "automated email" → Service Task |
| Include error paths | "If validation fails, return to customer" |
| Mention documents/data | "produces an invoice" → Data Object |

---

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| "No such file" error | Check `BPMN_Helpers.py` path matches your Modelio version |
| Script doesn't run | Select a **Package** before running |
| UnicodeDecodeError | Use ASCII only - no special characters like ✓ or → |
| Element in wrong lane | Check lane name spelling (case-sensitive) |
| Elements overlap | Increase `SPACING` or adjust column indices in layout |
| Text doesn't fit | Increase `TASK_WIDTH` and `TASK_HEIGHT` |
| Diagram is empty | Wait and refresh; check model tree for the process |
| Data object overlaps task | Adjust `DATA_OFFSET_Y` configuration |
| Data association arrow wrong | Verify source and target order |
